used_extra_debug_report:
  other: |
    NOTE: you have used extra-debug which creates a packets.log and a packets.log.gpg file
    please if you want to submit an issue only upload the packets.log.gpg file.
    packets.log and packets.log.gpg may include account info (never login info) so it is safer to upload the encrypted file.
    that file can be read by the developer and not by people looking at the public issues page.
